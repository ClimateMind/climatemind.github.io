        .teaser__headline Why do we need Climate Mind?
        .teaser__content
          .teaser__subline Thinking and talking about climate change is difficult.
          .teaser__text Too often we think climate change effects are distant or won’t personally affect us. Scientific reports use complex science which, for the majority of people, can be exhausting to digest.
          .teaser__text It can be a real challenge to learn how to communicate climate science to others, especially when others have different worldviews and beliefs. 
          .teaser__text Often, people don’t realize solutions exist that align with their existing values while being accessible, practical, viable and attractive.
