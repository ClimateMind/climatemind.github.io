Welcome!

We are still at the very beginning. Come back soon to find out more about our endeavours.


## Technical infos

The current setup relies on a legacy version of Node (verion 8.17.0). For the initial setup make sure to have this version installed and then run the following commands:

`nvm use 8.17.0` (temporary workaround, needed for legacy version of gulp)
`yarn` (installs the environment)
`gulp` (starts your local dev server)

To publish everything, run `gulp publish` and commit the changes (via a pull request) to master.

In the near future we are planning to migrate the entire web app over to React and the latest stable version of Node.
